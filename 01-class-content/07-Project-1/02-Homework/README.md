# Project 1

## Proposal

* Before you start coding, follow the directions below:
* Until you get my approval on your proposal, you should not code.
* Once you have completed the following instructions, @ me in the private slack channel

Create a github repo for your project, feel free to use the random name github gives you for a unique name
OR we can change the name later, initialize with a README. Copy the contents of the Good Readme Guide from Week 1.
Update with what you can - add collaborators to it with links to github/linkedin

Add all members as collaborators

Create a proposal.md in the repo with the following contents:

I understand that things from the proposal may change over the course of the project,
this is just a bit of preplanning

* Idea summary
* Proposed Developer Roles
* Proposed CSS Framework
* Proposed Server-Side APIs
* Proposed 3rd Party API
* Link to project board with User Story
* Wireframe Sketch of Design

Once you have completed the above sections and pushed it to the github repo,
copy the github repo link and live link (go ahead and deploy the main branch)
to the private slack channel and PIN them to the channel.
This makes it easy for me to help you and for me check on your progress.

Ping me in the private slack channel

While I review, you can lock the main branch, clone the repo, and create your personal branches.

## Application Requirements

Your project should fulfill the following requirements:

* Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.

* Be deployed to GitHub Pages.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Use at least two server-side APIs. (*IF YOU GET A CORS ERROR, FIND A DIFFERENT API*)

* Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).

* Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
* Be responsive.

* Have a polished UI.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

* You must have at least 20 quality commits over the course of the project. Work should be distributed.


## Presentation Requirements

* NO SLIDE SHOWS

* Elevator pitch: a one minute description of your application

* Concept: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?

* Process: What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?

* Demo: Show your stuff!

* Directions for Future Development

* Links to the deployed application and the GitHub repository
