Run the following code and explain the output


```js
var sample = function(){
    var a = b = 3;
    console.log(a);
}
sample();
console.log("Is a defined?", typeof a !== "undefined");
console.log("Is b defined?", typeof b !== "undefined");


var sample = function() {
    b = 3;
    var a = 3;
}


```



* `var a = b = 3` is equivalent to writing:
  ```js
  b = 3;
  var a = b; 
  ```

  * This means that `b` is created globally (unless you use strict mode) because there is no `var` keyword in the variable definition.

  * After `b` is created globally, `b` is assigned the value 3. Then `a` is created locally inside the function and assigned the value of `b`, which is 3. 
  
  * Because `a` is created locally, it doesnâ€™t exist outside the function.
